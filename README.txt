Lightweight tool to assess students by having them answer the essential question 1-on-1, sticky-note, or by manual grading. This tool is set up to allow teachers in schools, departments, grade levels, or teams to work side by side and compare data among educators. Teachers just need to add their class rosters and add exit ticket titles, and then check off each student one by one using checkboxes if they answered the question correctly.

A simple checkbox is set up with an AppScript running in the background that needs to be enabled (instructions are in the Google Sheet); once checked, it will manually run through all teachers and their students and compile the data for each of the data sheets within 10-90~ seconds, depending on the number of teachers and students compiled.

Highlights on why to use this tool
1. Insights gives you exact students by teacher who failed and passed each exit ticket
2. Reports displays students that consistently score high, low, are growing, or are decreasing
3. Rankings ranks each student by class period, teacher, and school.
4. Groups strategically partners students in High -> Low partnerships by sorting classes by high to low, cutting the list in half and placing them side by side. This ensures that the highest students never work with the lowest students which is frustrating for both partners. The highest students will work with high-mediums or high-lows. The lowest students will work with the middle-highs or high-lows. This way there is always a partner that can assist and coach and the lower partner gets additional support.
